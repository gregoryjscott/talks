# OSS, presented by a former skeptic

[Revolution OS] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jw8K460vx1c) - great movie, but...

OSS vs. Proprietary, and why OSS is winning

* the Ruby on Rails story

* the Silverlight story

* OSS tools are built by developers for developers

GitHub 

* discovering/reading OSS code has never been easier

* profile is your resume (employees & companies)

* follow your fellow [RDIers] (https://github.com/ResourceDataInc)

git - remember VSS?

cloud services - free for open, paid for closed

* e.g. [GitHub] (https://github.com/plans), [Pivotal Tracker] (http://www.pivotaltracker.com/pricing), [RavenDB] (http://ravendb.net/licensing), [Cloud9 IDE] (https://c9.io/site/pricing/), etc.

HTML5 + CSS + JS world is exclusively OSS

the most fun I've ever had coding

* [MvcTestIntegrationFramework] (https://github.com/gregoryjscott/MvcIntegrationTestFramework) inspired by [Steve Sanderson blog post] (http://blog.stevensanderson.com/2009/06/11/integration-testing-your-aspnet-mvc-application/)

* [Simpler] (https://github.com/gregoryjscott/Simpler)

* other micro ORMs: [Massive] (https://github.com/robconery/massive/), [PetaPoco] (https://github.com/toptensoftware/PetaPoco), [Dapper] (https://github.com/SamSaffron/dapper-dot-net)
 
* [Jimmy Bogard blog post on ORM strategy] (http://lostechies.com/jimmybogard/2012/07/20/choosing-an-orm-strategy/)

Mono - C# for Linux

* [Mono for Linux/Windows] (http://mono-project.com/Start)

* [MonoTouch for iOS] (http://xamarin.com/monotouch)

* [Mono for Android] (http://xamarin.com/monoforandroid)

Android - OSS vs. Apple

DevOps with [Vagrant] (http://vagrantup.com/), [Puppet] (http://puppetlabs.com/puppet/puppet-open-source/) and/or [Chef] (https://github.com/opscode/chef/)

the LAMP/MAMP installation experience

Releases - tool for deploying to client servers

* uses [Nuget] (http://nuget.codeplex.com/) and local Nuget repository

OSS licenses

* [by Name] (http://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical)

* [by Category] (http://opensource.org/licenses/category)

RDI OSS

* would attract new developers

* allow any/all RDI developers to collaborate

* it will happen, not if, but when

* ideas?
