# OSS by a former skeptic

OSS vs. Proprietary, and why OSS is winning

* the Ruby on Rails story

* the Silverlight story

* OSS tools are built by developers for developers

GitHub 

* discovering/reading OSS code has never been easier

* profile is your resume (employees & companies)

* follow your fellow RDIers

git - remember VSS?

cloud services - free for OSS, paid for closed

* e.g. GitHub, Pivotal Tracker, RavenDB, Cloud9 IDE, etc.

HTML5 + CSS + JS world is exclusively OSS

the most fun I've ever had coding

* MvcTestIntegrationFramework

* Steve Sanderson blog post

* Simpler

* Jimmy Bogard blog post

* Massive, PetaPoco, Dapper

Mono - C# for Linux

* MonoTouch for iOS

* Mono for Android

Android - OSS vs. Apple

DevOps with Vagrant, Puppet and/or Chef

the LAMP/MAMP installation experience

Releases - tool for deploying to client servers

* uses Nuget and Nuget repository

OSS licenses

RDI OSS

* would attract new developers

* allow any/all RDI developers to collaborate

* it will happen, not if, but when

* ideas?
